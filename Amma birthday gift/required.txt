{  
Oh! The rules and laws,
Aren’t they an abandoned cause,
Restrictions of the society,
Towards them, we lack piety.

Do we even practice what we preach,
Anger is outlasted by speech,
Yet everyday a child is thrashed,
Everyday a rule is trashed.

Every time a person is sent to gaol,
No one did wonder,
How can justice be in our control,
A life was sent away in soundless thunder.

How do we get to decide,
Who will live and who will die,
Who gave us the right,
Who gave us this emblazoned might.

Who decides good and bad,
Who decides happy or sad,
Who created these rules,
Who are these fools?

Who gave them the spotlight,
Everyone has free will,
No one can suppress with might,
It’s not justice, it’s a standstill.

Stereotyping and discriminating,
Extrapolating and cage-creating,
Why are these sentences blistered with flaws,
Why rules, why laws.

Hope,
The everlasting fuel tank,
Either a trusty rope,
Or a person guarding your flank.

In troubled times, your parent,
In losing days, your friends,
In stress, it is your vent,
In a dreary road, it is the bends.

In times of need, it’s money,
In sad times, your handkerchief,
In boring times, it’s things which are funny,
In times of defeat, of glory hope gives a whiff.

It is your ever- supporting conscience,
It is your trusty shadow,
In blindness, your lens,
In darkness, the faint glow.

It keeps you moving on,
It is your ever- standing companion,
It is your returning dreams, which were long gone,
It is the wind pushing you away from the deep canyon.

As we stumble around in the dark,
Hope has our hand,
Wherever we wander, expression stark,
Whether a withering forest or a desert land.

In life’s long tunnel,
It is the barely seen light,
As times narrow down, like the other end of a funnel,
Yet it channels our inner fight.

The old friend,
Weathering the times,
Showing a turning in every dead end,
In times of eerie silence, joyous wind chimes.

It has always been there,
When life has given us the sack,
In times of despair,
It always has and will have our back.

Though one day as it leaves our hand,
Feeling rather sore,
We know it is the end of the strand,
We remain no more.

There always is hope,
While falling, there always is that rope.

What is understanding?
A mother understands her children,
The father too is understanding,
Till they’re grown-up men.

A scientist understands his discovery,
A teacher understands her students,
A seed is only understood by a tree,
Only a volcano understands its vents.

What is this instinctive understanding,
We’ve searched everywhere during this task,
On no conclusion are we ever landing,
But I ask,

Why not leave everything be,
Someday our eyes will open to be able to see.
}

{
Frolicking in the sun,
Life a bubble of fun,
Don’t take stress,
Just care less.

Why worry about money,
Oh, don’t look at me funny,
I’m enjoying, why, I have no clue,
But let me rub it off on you too.

Pure optimism,
Will reduce your pessimistic wisdom,
Clearing those black spots,
Chasing away those mental clots.

Pure ecstasy,
Can lift you out of a life gone messy,
Stop being serious,
People’ll think you’re delirious.

Sure, have caution,
Or soon, you’ll reach joy’s exhaustion,
But let life have its way,
Enjoy each rapturous day.

Why worry,
Difficulties go in a flurry,
Savour them while they last,
Just don’t let go of the ship’s mast.

Fill yourself to the brim,
With triumph enjoy your swim,
With endless joy let yourself bloat,
At sadness, darkness, pessimism just gloat.

Float up to cloud nine,
And on joy and exuberance dine.
}

{
Laughter :

The remedy for all ailments,
It costs no money, neither rupees nor cents,
God’s gift is its say,
It cures you no matter how old or fray.

It lifts you out of darkness,
It uplifts you despite starkness,
Wrapping you in its warm embrace,
All trouble it can face.

It revives that smile,
No matter how far, a light-year or a mile,
Sublime is laughter,
Dousing life’s unhealthy clatter.

Laugh till you cry,
Laugh till you sigh!

{
Tolerant and bigots,
White spots and black spots,
Conventional and unconventional,
Legal and criminal.

Good and bad,
Happy and sad,
Justice and unfair,
Ruthlessness and care.

War and peace,
Imprisonment and lease,
All listed on a scroll,
All in somebody’s control.

Life or death,
Defeat or a laurel wreath,
All are decided upon,
By somebody who is right or maybe even wrong.

Profit or loss,
Dry or sauce,
All in somebody’s careless hands,
With the power of 100 hands.

Well, who bestowed these hands with power,
Who gave them the right to glower,
Who allowed them to criticize,
Who allowed them to gamble truth with lies.

What self-acclaimed posts,
What inhospitable hosts,
What phagocytes,
What greedy termites.

All define us,
Don’t fuss,
All define the human race,
Now go back and see your face.

“Our glorious feats”,
We say; what cheats.
Bravado is what truth does decree,
We let our imagination run free.

Let me define a human being,
Perpetually scared and fleeing,
Why do we have a brain,
Now, this thought makes us go insane.

Overgrown brats wanting our way,
Everything must go by our say,
That’s our very worst,
In ourselves, we are perpetually immersed.

Now I understand why humanity,
Rhymes so well with insanity.

{
There was a tiny seed,
Much older than you,
Like a 1000 years older,
Known by only a few.

Grew slowly,
Under no threatening shade,
In rich soil,
In an open glade.

Many years later,
It dispersed its seeds,
Some fell into rivers,
Some were tangled in reeds.

But one special seed survived,
And grew into a tall tree,
For many years,
It lived free.

But men came along,
And harvested it,
By now on your parent’s lap,
You would’ve begun to sit.

The men used it to make paper,
And in it was written a story,
Blind to reality,
Blind to history.

OUt of it was made a book,
That you just read,
And you thought it was finished,
Though nowhere it led.

If only you looked carefully enough,
Etched invisible in its fabric,
As you had wrongly wondered,
The seed hadn’t yet finished its magic.
